# Credit-Card-Transaction-Fraud-Detection
## Summary: 
We have a dataset that contains includes credit card transactions made by European cardholders over a period of two days in September 2013. Out of a total of 2,84,807 transactions, 492 were fraudulent. This data set is highly unbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for 0.172% of the total transactions.
We need to create ML model to identify the fraudulent transaction with the help of this data.
## Objective:  
1.  As the fraudulent transactions are usually very less as compared to legitimate ones, the same is reflected in dataset as well, so take care of the data imbalance due this fact
2. Identify the fraudulent transactions based on the historical transactions
## Outcome: 
Several models, Logistic regression, Decision Tree, random forest etc are created with different hyperparameter tuning, the best model have following evaluation metrics
1. F1 Score - 0.94
2. Precision - 94.61%
3. Recall - 92.44%
4. Sensitivity - 92.44%
5. Specificity - 94.74%
6. Accuracy - 93.59%
